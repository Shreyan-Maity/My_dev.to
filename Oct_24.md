To be started with any one of them you need to start with a **Free Trial** account or with **Pay As You Go**.

To be starting with **Free Trial** 
 >###### AWS
 >**Free trials some minimal services till 12 months**
 >###### Azure
 >**$200 for 30 days Free tier eligible services**
 >###### GCP
 >**$300 for 90 days Free tier eligible services**

In my opinion you can start with **AWS** for the free trial. You get some extend of time to explore most of the services available.

To be starting with **Pay as you go** you can choose accordingly with the below reference.
